Frequently Asked Questions
1. What is balayage, and how is it different from traditional highlighting techniques?
Balayage is a French hair coloring technique where color is painted onto the hair to create a natural, graduated effect. Unlike traditional highlighting techniques that use foils to create uniform color placement, balayage allows for a softer, more blended look, resulting in sun-kissed highlights that mimic the natural variations in hair color.

2. How long does a balayage appointment typically take?
The duration of a balayage appointment can vary depending on the length and thickness of your hair, as well as the desired result. On average, a balayage session can take anywhere from two to four hours. It's best to consult with your stylist beforehand to get an accurate estimate based on your specific hair needs.

3. Will balayage damage my hair?
When done correctly by a skilled stylist using quality products, balayage should not cause significant damage to your hair. Unlike traditional highlighting techniques that involve saturating the entire section of hair with bleach, balayage only lightly coats the surface, minimizing the risk of damage. However, it's essential to follow your stylist's aftercare instructions to maintain the health and integrity of your hair.
